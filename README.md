# TikTok Username Checker :mag_right:

A Python script to check the existence and number of followers of TikTok usernames. You can also generate random usernames to check.

🔧 Installation:
- Clone this repository
- Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

🚀 Usage:
- Run the script: `python main.py`
- Choose an option from the menu:
  - [1] Check Usernames: checks the usernames stored in `usernames.txt`
  - [2] Generate Usernames: generates random usernames to store in `usernames.txt`
  - [3] Github: opens github repo
  - [4] Exit: exits the program
- When checking usernames, the program will print if the username exists and the number of followers. It will also update `usernames.txt` by removing the checked usernames and adding the ones that don't exist to `hits.txt`.

📝 Notes:
- It is not very fast.
